/*
when one system is connected to multi processor to complete the task
eg: one operating system and 3 CPU
It is best suited at system level or OS
Interview Questions:-  What is diff btwn process and thread?
Process:-
A program which is in executing state
it is heavy weight
it takes more time for context switching(CPU switches in nanoseconds b/w process(p1 and p2) and illustrate as if pi and p2 is running at same time
It takes more time for inter process communication
Each process has diff address space
process are not dependent on each other
process does not require synchronization
Resources consumption is more
process require more time for creation
It takes more time for termination

Threads:-
It is sub part of process(small task)
It is light weight
It takes less time for context switching
It takes less time for inter thread communication
Each thread share same address space
Threads are dependent on each other
Threads require synchronization
Resources consumption is less
Threads require less time for creation
It takes less time for termination
