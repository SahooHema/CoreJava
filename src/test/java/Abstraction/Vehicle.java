/*Abstraction:- Hiding the details of method, varaiables in class
 using abstract keyword before class, before method as well
 using extends keyword
 acheive method overriding 
 cannot create object of abstract class
 through abstraction can acheive 0-100% abstraction
 through interface can acheive 100% abstraction
 it is necessary to implement abstract method in child class
