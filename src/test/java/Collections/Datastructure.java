/*
Data structure:- we can store data in efficient way(time and space complexity) in memory..
time and space complexity means using algorithm i.e. searching, sorting, insertion, deletion and updation..
Types of DS:- 1.primitive 2.non-primitive
1.primitive:- int, chr,long,short,boolean,double,float,byte (store only one type of data eg: int a=10;)
2.non-primitive is of 2 types:- a) linear b)non-linear(store multiple set of data(different characters) in entity eg:-String s="hema".. )
a)linear:- array,list,set,string,arraylist,queue,lhs,hs
b)non-liner:-graph, trees
collection:-Java has provided pre-defined api's for non-primitive DS.. api has prefdefined classes and methods ..we can use methods to perform operations..

primitive is used for simple applications i.e. calculator
non-primitive is used for e-commerce,social networking sites
