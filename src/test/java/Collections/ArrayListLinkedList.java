important for interview Difference between Arraylist and linkedlist
	ArrayList:-
	1.arraylist act as list
	synatx:- ArrayList implements List
	2.underline DS is growable and resizable
	3.elements are stored in contigeous memory locations
	4.good for retrieval operations 

	LinkedList:-
	1.linkedlist act as  list and queue
	syntax:- linkedlist implements list,deque
	2.underline DS is doubly linkedlist, circular linkedlist
	3.elements are not stored in contigeous memory locations
	4.good for insertion or deletion operations
	
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 1.arraylist is implemented class of list interface which is present in java.util package
 2.	created on the basis of growable or resizeable array
 5.does not store elements in sorting order
 	
 	
 	
 linkedlist
 doubly linkedlist-> element and next node address
 circular linkedlist-> previous node address and element and next node address	
 
 	ll.add("hema");
 	l1.add("sahoo");
 DLL:-	node is created and the  first node element is hema and previous node address is null and next node address will be of sahoo
 circular:- last node address will point to first node address
