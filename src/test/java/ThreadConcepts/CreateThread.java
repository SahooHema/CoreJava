/*
There are 2 ways to create thread:- 1)Thread Class 2)Runnable Interface
Thread class is under java.lang package
Only run() is present in Runnable interface
Thread class has diff methods and constructors
Thread class implements Runnable interface
interview Question:- what is the obj.start() (it will invoke thread  and create  call stack for that thread)
Note:- Interview Question-> can we invoke start() again? what error it will give compile time or run time?
If write 2 times start(), it will give error coz once start() finished task , it becomes dead..
Note:which method is better among Thread and Runnable? Runnable 
Class A extends B (in this if we want to create thread of class A we cannot create.inheritance does not support multiple inheritance)
Class A extends B implements Runnable (interface supports multiple inheritance)
