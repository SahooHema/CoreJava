Some key differences between the Map and HashMap are as follows:

The Map is an interface, and HashMap is a class of the Java collection framework.
The Map interface can be implemented by using its implementing classes. In comparison, the HashMap class implements the Map interface.
The Map contains unique key-pair values. But, the HashMap can hold duplicate values.
The Map does not allow null values. But the HashMap can have one null key and multiple values.
The Map has two implementations, which are HashMap and TreeMap. Whereas HashMap implements Map interface and extends AbstractMap class.
There is no difference between the Map and HashMap objects.
	 

	///difference between set,hashset and treeset///////////////////
A Set is a generic set of values with no duplicate elements. A TreeSet is a set where the elements are sorted.

A HashSet is a set where the elements are not sorted or ordered. It is faster than a TreeSet. The HashSet is an implementation of a Set.	 
	 
	 
	 
/////////////////////////difference b/w map and set////////////////////////////////
Set:-
1.	Set is used to construct the mathematical Set in Java.	
2.	It cannot contain repeated values.	
3.	Set doesn't allow us to add the same elements in it. Each class that implements the Set interface contains only the unique value.	
4.	We can easily iterate the Set elements using the keyset() and the entryset() method of it.	
5.	Insertion order is not maintained by the Set interface. However, some of its classes, like LinkedHashSet, maintains the insertion order.	
 
	 
Map:-	 
Map is used to do mapping in the database.	 
It can have the same value for different keys.	 
Map contains unique key and repeated values. In Map, one or more keys can have the same values, but two keys cannot be the same.	 
Map elements cannot be iterated. We need to convert Map into Set for iterating the elements.	 
The insertion order is also not maintained by the Map. However, some of the Map classes like TreeMap and LinkedHashMap does the same.	 	 
does not follow sorting order
