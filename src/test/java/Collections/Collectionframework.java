public class Collectionframework {
	/*
//////////////////difference between collection and array//////////////////////
1. it stores only non-primitive data(objects) eg:-
ArrayList al=new ArrayList();
al.add(10);
2.It stores diff types of data	 eg:-

ArrayList al=new ArrayList();
al.add(10);
al.add(10.8f);

3.size is not  fixed can increase or decrease size of collections during runtime..
4.It is pre-defined api's which has prefdefined classes,interfaces and methods ..we can use methods to perform operations..

//////////////////About collection framework//////////////////////
what is collection?
it is an entity or an object where in we can store multiple sets of data
eg:-ArrayList al=new ArrayList();
al.add(10);
al.add("hema");

eg:- HashMap hs=new HashMap();
hs.put(10);
hs.put(20);

what is framework?
it is an api which has different pre-defined classes and interfaces	 

what is  Collectionframework?	 
It is set of pre-defined classes and interfaces	 which is used for  storing multiple sets of data

It contains 2 parts:- 1. java.util.collection 2.java.util.Map
	 
1. java.util.collection-: stores data directly 
2.java.util.Map:- stores data in the form of key value pair
	 
Hierarchy of collection framework?
Legacy class->it is c/d LC coz it is modified in collection framework
interface extends interface
class implements interface
	
What is collection interface?
collection is an interface which is present in java.util package
syntax:- public interface Collection<E> extends Iterable <E>
methods :- add(), allAll(),remove(), removeall(), contains(),clear(),isempty(),size()..
