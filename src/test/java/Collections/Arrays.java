1.store pimitive and non-primitive data(objects)
	primitve i.e. int..
	non-primitive i.e.
	Test obj1=new Test();
	Test obj2=new Test();
	 Test[] t={obj1,obj2};
2.stores same type of data	eg:-
int[] a={10,20,40};
int[] a={10,'x',30,40};
we can pass char it will type caste into int but cannot pass boolean,float,long.double into an array
3.size is fixed	cannot increase or decrease size of an array during runtime..
4.it has inbuilt features of java, thus we need to devlop algorithm
